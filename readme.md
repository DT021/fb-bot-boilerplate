# Facebook Messenger Bot

This simple python template is an extension a previous repo of this [tutorial](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/fb-messenger-bot/) of @hartleybrody.
I simply extended it a little bit with quick and dirty FAQ bot.
You can insert your questions and you answers in these files

```core/nlp_config/questions.py```

and

```core/nlp_config/answers.py```

that are situated in ```core/nlp_config```. For configuring your facebook page and heroku to run with this code, please refer to the previous link. It is an excellent work by
@hartleybrody.
